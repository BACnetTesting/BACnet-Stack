// BITS does not use Steve's global "config.h". We use a local "configProj.h"
// which allows the application to be compiled differently on a case-by-case basis
// (project-by-project).  Include a configProj.h in your project directory
// and then make sure that this project directory is first in your include list

#include "configProj.h"
