*   June 30, 2018   BITS    Renamed this from timer.h to timerCommon.h because of collisions
*                           with h files in other platforms. Moved it to include/ because
*                           the functions are general amongst most platforms. Platform
*                           specific declarations can remain in ports\*\something.h
