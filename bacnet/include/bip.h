12.11.18 Max_APDU_Length_Accepted

This property, of type Unsigned, is the maximum number of octets that may be contained in a single, indivisible application
layer protocol data unit. The value of this property shall be greater than or equal to 50. The value of this property is also
constrained by the underlying data link technology and shall be less than or equal to the largest APDU_Length of the enabled
Network Port objects used to represent the underlying data links. See Clauses 6 through 11, Annex J, Annex O, and Annex U.
If the value of this property is not encodable in the 'Max APDU Length Accepted' parameter of a ConfirmedRequest-PDU,
then the value encoded shall be the highest encodable value less than the value of this property. In such cases, a responding
device may ignore the encoded value in favor of the value of this property, if it is known.

/* 
    The most common Ethernet packet frame can carry 1500 bytes of payload.. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame#Ethernet_II
    UDP packets have to be packed within this.. so 1500 less IP header (20 bytes), less UDP header (8 bytes) 
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol#Packet_structure
            https://notes.shichao.io/tcpv1/ch10/
    leaves LPDU for BACnet/IP of 1472. A packet any longer than this will result in fragmented packets, so we would like to draw the line here
    However. BACnet specifies a possible MAX_LPDU_IP of 1476, and many people use it (fragmented), so we need to accomodate these reassembled
    packets. Lets just shame those users who go to the limit, allow it, and for ourselves just set a lower threshold...

    Note that the result of 1492-10-22 is  1460. But BACnet was defined using BACnet/Ethernet
    So we are stuck with that. If packets are build using 1476 bytes, they WILL fragment over IPv4 UDP, and 
    according to Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the underlying layer, (looking at you IPv6 at 1280) 
    possibly sooner.
