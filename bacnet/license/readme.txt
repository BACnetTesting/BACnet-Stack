Licenses for the BACnet Stack at SourceForge

This BACnet protocol stack implementation is specifically
designed for the embedded BACnet appliance, using a GPL with
exception license (like eCos), which means that any changes
to the core code that are distributed must be made available
in accordance with section (3) of the GNU General Public License.
However, the BACnet library can be linked to proprietary code
without the proprietary code becoming GPL.

The text of the GPL exception included in each source file
is as follows:

    "As a special exception, if other files instantiate
     templates or use macros or inline functions from
     this file, or you compile this file and link it
     with other works to produce a work based on this file,
     this file does not by itself cause the resulting work
     to be covered by the GNU General Public License.
     However the source code for this file must still be
     made available in accordance with section (3) of the
     GNU General Public License."

Each file that is subject to the GPL uses the following text comment
at the top of the file:

LGPLv3 Boilerplate

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the Lesser General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU LGPLv3, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  The GNU Lesser General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
