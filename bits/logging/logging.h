/* 
    This (extensible) logging approach is based on the ability for multiple observers to register
    with the logging dispatcher.
    
    A 'log item' is a text string, of unlimited length (actually, ethernet packet size), along with 
    a priority, and a subsystem.

    A list of registered observers, along with their subsystem(s) of interest, and the priority is
    maintained.

    An observer may register for different subsystems at different priorities. Typically 'all'
    subsystems at lowest priority, and then the noise is then filtered out by eliminating 
    the subsystems/raising priorities one by one.

    The code logs with a given subsystem at a given priority.

    Input devices can also register. These can be keyboards, BTA, telnet, etc.
