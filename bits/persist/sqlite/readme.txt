Only parts of the sqlite library are included here. Not included are the sqlite3ext.h header for creating extensions
and shell.c for creating command line database access utility as they are not needed for this project.

Users of the BBRS library are encouraged to find out more about these at: https://sqlite.org/index.html

For ways of using sqlite3 for persistence with BITS projects, see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l4Hp0rlFqEFxdCgmDUZqQk6E8KxJEZvP7a4Q1pDs7G0/edit?usp=sharing
