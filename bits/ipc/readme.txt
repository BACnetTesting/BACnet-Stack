The IPC layer serves as a communications link between an Application and the BACnet stack
=========================================================================================

It may be implemented serially, via UDP sockets, shared memory etc.

The intent is for the application to not to worry about "BACnet Stuff", but yet still be able to

        a) Create BACnet Devices, Objects
        b) Populate their BACnet Properties
        c) Update them with real-time values

Everything is Big Endian
Because of different architectures and word sizes, all ints are defined explicitly
Floats are IEEE format

The 'commands' necessary for this link may be implemented in various ways, but as a starting point,
they need values..

        0b00xxxxxx      Application to BACnet messages
        0b10xxxxxx      BACnet to App messages
        0b11xxxxxx      Bidirectional

----    -------                 -----------------
81      Restart App
82      Ping                    (used to determine if interface is alive)

Datatypes: STRING, OBJID, FLOAT
-------------------------------

The data type and format is defined by a tagged system based on the BACnet specification. This means the type and the length
of the data field is embedded in the parameter. See the specification, "20.2.1 General Rules For Encoding BACnet Tags"

Since the data format is 'self referencing' fields that specify VALUE could be in any of the above formats.
