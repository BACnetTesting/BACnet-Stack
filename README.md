# BACnet-Stack

This is a fork of the Open Source BACnet Stack based on Steve Karg's SourceForge very popular project. I created this 
in order to create a publicly accessible source tree of the changes and (ahem) improvements that we ac ConnectEx, Inc.
have made to the original.

We will only maintain a linux 'make' and a Microsoft Visual Studio implementation using the latest free Microsoft tools.
