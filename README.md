This compiles and runs on solo board (A9 / Linux)

2017.01.05 - Ed: I see that they have stripped ai.c av.c bv.c apdu.c etc. in AVR (now copied to CortexM4) to 'simplify' the build.
I prefer to use the originals with #defines to remove unwanted functionality.
We can do that eventally, keep going on the current plan.
